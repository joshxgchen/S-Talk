# S-Talk
A fully functional CLI chat interface for machines connected locally. This was a several week long project for my CMPT 300 class, was an individual project. To use, simply type `make` into the Terminal, and type `./s-talk 8.8.8.8` with the terminal, and `8.8.8.8` being replaced by the IP address you want to connect to.
